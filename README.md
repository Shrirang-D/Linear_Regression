## Linear Regression with Scratch

* Code _Simple_Linear_regression_from_scratch.ipynb_ is the implementation of single variable Linear Regression with placements dataset
* Code _Linear_Regression_from_Scratch.ipynb_ is the implementation of Multivariate Linear Regression with Iris dataset.
* Both codes then compare the results of algorithm from scratch with SKLearn's in-built Linear Regression Algorithm
